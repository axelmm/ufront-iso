	<p>Playground for learning ufront and finding out if and how we can use it for isometric solutions</p>

<div class="page-header"><h2>Why isometric?</h2></div>

<div class="row"><div class="col-md-12">

	<p>The idea of isometric web solutions is to combine the best of two worlds:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>standard server round-trip soluitions: SEO, linkability, all browser-compatibility etc.</li>
		<li>client side single-page solutions: speed, elegance, clever use of bandwidht etc.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>It shouldn't matter if an uri is served from the server or run on the client. There should be no problem with older browsers not understanding pushstate etc - they will just request the pages as standard server requests.</p>

<div class="page-header"><h2>Client side ufront</h2></div>

<div class="row"><div class="col-md-12">

	<p>UFront is built from the bottom to be used on async platforms (js, nodejs) as well as sync ones (php, neko etc.) This makes it possible to run a full-fledged ufront-mvc in the browser. This ufront-iso demo shows how that can be done by using customized request and response classes.</p>

	<p>Please note that this demo is very basic and experimental!</p>
